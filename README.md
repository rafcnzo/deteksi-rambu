# Python Project Setup

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
2. **pip**: Python package installer
3. **Command Prompt** (cmd): To run commands

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up the Python project on your local machine:

### 1. Download the Project Files

Download the project files from the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

Alternatively, if you have Git installed, you can clone the repository:

```cmd
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with your Git repository URL and `<repository-folder>` with the desired folder name.

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

```cmd
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **Windows**:
  ```cmd
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

If your project has specific library dependencies, install them manually using pip. For example:

```cmd
pip install library_name
```

Replace `library_name` with the libraries needed for your project. You can install multiple libraries as required.

### 4. Running Python Scripts

To run Python scripts in the project, use the following command in Command Prompt:

```cmd
python <script-name>.py
```

Replace `<script-name>` with the name of the Python file you want to execute.

### 5. Working with Jupyter Notebooks

If the project includes Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`), ensure Jupyter is installed:

```cmd
pip install jupyter
```

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```cmd
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. Navigate to the desired `.ipynb` file and start working.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure the virtual environment is activated whenever working on the project to avoid dependency conflicts.
- For any issues or questions, please open an issue in the repository or contact the project maintainers.
